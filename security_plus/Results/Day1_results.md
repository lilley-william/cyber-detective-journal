Q2
Originally answered incorrectly, fixed my answer with this explanation:
	- Q2 is confidentiality because the encryption is making what is seen, is only seen by those who can see it. Basically, the encryption is turning something into another language that only people who speak that language can read it, thus, keeping it confidential. 


Q3
Originally answered this question wrong but corrected it with this explanation:
Q6 the correct answer is D, availability. Authentication, authorization, and accountability are all apart of the IAAA. Identification - username, confirming who you are, authentication - password, confirming that I have access with these credentials, authorization - what you have access to, confirming what your credentials have access to once you're logged in, accountability - system logs, a way for an administrator to see what you've been doing with your access. This leaves availability, which is part of the CIA model and is used to ensure that items within IT are kept available through redundancies.
