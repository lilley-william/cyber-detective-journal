# Security+ Journal â€“ Day 1

## Thursday, October 2, 2025

## Topics Covered
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- IAAA (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
- Risk, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Exploits
- Threat Actors (Nation-state, Hacktivist, Insider, Script Kiddie, Cybercriminal)

## Key Takeaways
- CIA is a crucial system that is used to make sure data is kept safe and un-corrupted and out of view from those it shouldn't be; all of this all of the time, anytime. 
- IAAA is used to behind the scenes out of view from the end-user during the login phase and active use phases of the data use process. Each piece to the IAAA process keeps data secure and used only when necessary and allowed. 
- Threat actors come in all shapes and sizes, and while it's not a one size fits all way of profiling each actor, it is a great start when trying to reverse engineer and solve who is doing what and for why.

## Practice Test Results
- Score: 8/10
- Questions and results/explanations of incorrect answers will be included in respective folders

## Reflections
- What concepts felt easiest today?
	- Understanding the IAAA and CIA process seems to be common sense and was easy to apply to everything.
- What concepts do I need to review again?
	- While the above two processes seem common sense, they are also not hard to get letters mixed up. I need to brush up on defenitions and practicial applications to strengthen my understanding. 
- One analogy or real-life example that helped me remember something:
	- Using CIA in a hospital.
		- Confidentiality
			- Don't want anyone outside of the "need to know" group to access patient files
		- Integrity
			- Want to make sure all information is accurate and unchanged from input as it could be crucial to patient care
				- If patient is allergic to X and the data's integrity is changed to show patient is allergic to Y, then this could cause the patient to be given the wrong substance due to invalid data
		- Availability
			- Patient data needs to be available instantly.

## Next Steps
- Watch videos for Day 2
- Review missed Day 1 questions
- Prepare Day 2 journal entry
